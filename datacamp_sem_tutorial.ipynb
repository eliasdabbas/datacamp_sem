    "As a heavy user of Datacamp since two years, I learned quite a lot. My main business is in online marketing, and I have benefited a lot from the data science skills I learned. I'm now able to manage way larger and more complex campaigns, and efficiently maintain them. Since I'm quite familiar now with the content and the different topics and packages in R and Python, I thought about how I might create search campaigns for Datacamp, just as an exercise. Hopefully, this serves as a real life example of how these skills are used in real projects.    \n",

    "The three main components of a search campaign are:     \n",
    "1. **Keywords:** the user's intention, what they are looking for.     \n",
    "2. **Ads:** your promise to the user for that intention.    \n",
    "3. **Landig pages:** your delivery of the promise.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Mapping those three elements properly is around 70-80% of the job. If you get this right, then  maintenance and changes become much easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, in order to be specific and relevant to users, we need to promote the stuff that we have, and mainly focus on sending the right person to the right page, through the right message / expectation. \n",
    "\n",
    "A good campaign structure reflects and follows the structure of the website, which is essentially reflecting the business strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic unit of organization is called the ad group. This is where the mapping of keywords, ads and landing pages happens. Every ad group needs to be part of a campaign. At the campaign level we have settings that govern all ad groups in the campaign; language targeting, locations, devices, time of day, etc. \n",

    "- broad match (no punctuation) would trigger our ads if someone searches for anything similar to or related to 'data science course'. This is up to Google's algorithms, and you have to be careful with it, as it might trigger ads when someone searches for 'data science platform' for example, which is not exactly what we are trying to promote. I like to use the modified broach match more, because it restricts targeting a little more. This is basically triggering ads if someoe searches for any derivative of the word, and not any similar word in meaning. This is denoted with a '+' sign at the begininning of the word. So, '+game' would trigger ads by 'gaming', 'gamers', but by 'play'. \n",

    "1. Create ad templates to use (2-3 should be good to start with)\n",
